孙子曰：凡治众如治寡，分数是也；斗众如斗寡，形名是也；三军之众，可使必受敌而无败者，奇正是也；兵之所加，如以碫（duan4）投卵者，虚实是也。

As Sunzi said, generally speaking, 

- if you feel managing a large scale troops is just as easy as managing a small team of soliders, that is because of the troop's organization is rationale; 

- if you're directing a large scale war is just as easy as directing a small team of soliders battle, it is because there're clear flag sign, loud enough drum, and streamlined communications; 

- the key that prevent your troop from failure when being attacked by the emeny, is to use "Qi-Zheng" (creative-normal) tactics based on the variable situations;

- if you want to direct your troops attacking the ememy, and want to defeat ememy just like using a stone to hit an egg, the key is the properly using the strategy "Avoid the real and attack the virtual".
